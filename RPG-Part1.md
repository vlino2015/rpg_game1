# RPG Game Part 1

## Step 1
Make a Hero class to store the health and power of the hero, and make a `Goblin` class to store the health and power of the goblin. Use a hero object in place of the variables `hero_health` and `hero_power` and use a goblin object in place of the variables `goblin_health` and `goblin_power` all through out the app.

## Step 2
Take the code for the hero attacking the goblin and extract it into a method (call it `attack`) of the `Hero` class. Replace the existing code with a call to the attack method. Hint: `attack` should take in the goblin (enemy) as a parameter: `hero.attack(goblin)`

## Step 3
Similarly, take the code for the goblin attacking the hero and extract it into a method (also call it `attack`) of the Goblin class. Replace the existing code with a call to the attack method. It should look like `goblin.attack(hero)`.

## Step 4
Refactor the while condition:

`while goblin.health > 0 and hero.health > 0:`

to

`while goblin.alive() and hero.alive():`

The health checks should be moved to within the alive methods of Hero and Goblin respectively.

## Step 5
Take the code for printing the health status of the hero and move it into a method called `print_status` of `Hero`. Do the same for the goblin.

## Step 6
Do you see a lot of duplicated or similar code between `Hero` and `Goblin`? What if you can share the duplicated code between them? You can by using inheritance! Create a new class called `Character` and make both `Hero` and `Goblin` inherit from it.

## Step 7
The alive methods on `Hero` and `Goblin` should be identical. Move it into `Character`, and remove them from `Hero` and `Goblin` - now they can simply inherit it from `Character`.

## Step 8: Bonus Challenge
The methods `attack` and `print_status` method in `Hero` and `Goblin` look almost identical, but not quite. Is it possible to move them into the `Character` class as well? Give it a try.

## Step 9: Bonus Challenge 2
Create a zombie character that cannot die and have it fight the hero instead of the goblin.
