# RPG Game
In this exercise, you will develop a hero RPG (*Role Playing Game*) using all of the cool new python knowledge you've acquired. This game will be created using **Object Oriented Programming**.

The game starts off with 2 characters: a `hero` and a `goblin`. Each character will be given a starting health and starting value. 

Each character also has a power that can be used to attack their opponent. In the initial scenario, the `hero's` opponent is the `goblin`, and the `goblin's` opponent is the `hero`.

When either character attacks his/her opponent, the opponent's health will decrease by the amount of power of the attacking character.

For example
>
>If the hero starts off with the following: 
>
>- health = 9
>- power = 4
>
>And the `goblin` starts off with the following:  
>
>- health = 7
>- power = 3
>
>Then when the hero attacks the goblin, the goblin's health will decrease by 4.
>
>The result of goblin's health after being attacked
>
>- health = 3  ==> (7 - 4)
>- power = 3
>
